Hello! 
--------
My name is Haiyan Hao (郝海燕), and I am an Assistant Professor in the Division of Computational Social Science (CSS) at the School of Humanities and Social Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen). Before joining CUHK-Shenzhen, I earned my Ph.D. in Urban and Regional Planning from the University of Florida. You can learn more about my academic background and activities on my [official website](https://myweb.cuhk.edu.cn/haohaiyan). 

My research focuses on leveraging advanced analytics and computational approaches to empower human communities in addressing a wide range of social and environmental challenges—such as technological disruptions and extreme events—with the goal of contributing to smart and resilient urban development. My past work has incorporated a variety of techniques, including:
- Geo-simulation (e.g., cellular automata, agent-based modeling)
- Multi-modal social media data mining
- GeoAI (e.g., graph-based deep learning GCN & GAT, spatio-temporal deep learning, interpretable/explainable AI)
- Real-time computing frameworks (e.g., Apache Spark, Kafka, Flink)
- Conventional statistical approaches, machine learning models, Bayesian Network model, network analysis, etc.

These methods have supported several National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded projects aimed at enhancing community resilience and informing data-driven urban planning. To learn more about my research, feel free to explore my profiles on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=G2_Cs-cAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Haiyan-Hao-2?ev=hdr_xprf).

Recent Research Directions:
--------
My recent studies focuses on:
- LLM-assisted KG construction to model & simulate complex urban crisis evolution
- LLM-assisted geo-simulation supporting urban scenario planning
- etc.
