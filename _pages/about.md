Hello! 
--------
My name is Haiyan Hao (郝海燕), and I am an Assistant Professor affiliated with both the Division of Computational Social Science and the Division of Development and Governance at the School of Humanities and Social Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen).
You can learn more about my academic background and activities on my [official website](https://myweb.cuhk.edu.cn/haohaiyan). Before joining CUHK-Shenzhen, I earned my Ph.D. in Urban and Regional Planning from the University of Florida.

My research focuses on leveraging advanced analytics and computational approaches to empower human communities in addressing a wide range of social and environmental challenges—such as technological disruptions and extreme events—with the goal of contributing to smart and resilient urban development. My past work has incorporated a variety of techniques, including:
- Geo-simulation (e.g., cellular automata, agent-based modeling)
- Multi-modal social media data mining
- GeoAI (e.g., graph-based deep learning GCN & GAT, spatio-temporal deep learning, interpretable/explainable AI)
- Real-time computing frameworks (e.g., Apache Spark, Kafka, Flink)
- Conventional statistical approaches, machine learning models, Bayesian Network model, network analysis, etc.

These methods have supported several National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded projects aimed at enhancing community resilience and informing data-driven urban planning. To learn more about my research, feel free to explore my profiles on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=G2_Cs-cAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Haiyan-Hao-2?ev=hdr_xprf).

Recent Research Directions:
--------
- LLM-assisted KG construction to model complex urban crisis evolution
- LLM-assisted geo-simulation for informed urban project planning & evaluation
- Integrating urban data streams and digital twins to support adaptive urban management and decision-making
- etc.
